This is a C header file for ida parsing gamemd.exe of Yuri's Revenge.
It was created by using some of public YRpps, and I improve and modify it in use.
For convenience, this is actually not entire, but it is still very practical for light users.
You can use Ctrl+F9 in ida to directly parsing this C header file.
Meanwhile, I have also marked some VTables addresses, so you can search them in this file.
Hope it helpful.
